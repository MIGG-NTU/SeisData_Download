    "\n",
    "Nowadays, we have many seismic time series data which can be used to study the Earth's interior and seismic source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we'd better to do some data quality control to first select **high-quanlity** data and do the first-round analyses. We can then come back to increase some more data with **medium or low quality** based on the experince learned from the high-quality data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can decide the data quality based on some custom quantities. The most commonly used one is **singal-noise ratio (SNR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SNR = signal energy / noise energy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Either signal or noise energy can be custom defined, e.g., the averaged, absolute maximum, or root-mean-square amplitude in a signal or noie time window. The time windows for singal and noise are also custom defined. For example, we may define the signal time window as 5 second before and 15 second after the theoretical arrival time, while the noise time window from 30 second to 10 second before the theoretical arrival time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important point is to find a good criterion to select the **high-quanlity** data. It usually depends on the definition of the custom quantity and the real data quality."
